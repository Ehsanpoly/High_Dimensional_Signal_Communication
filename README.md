# High_Dimensional_Signal_Communication
We see how real optimized and fast communication protocols (CAN, BACnet, Profibus, etc.) transmission through wirless connection can boost the efficiecy of system. In next repository, I will implement this idea with FPGA in real world with hardware PCB designing to prove how we can increase performance. 

I have conducted a practical researh on memory analysis and data transfering to make an efficient way for monitoring low-level events in embedded systems. In couple of posts I try to dynamically observe the underhood of memory and data relation with a proposed Wifi data transfer, serial communication, real-time analysis, and monitoring the memory.
Converting serial communication to Wi-Fi enables real-time monitoring, cloud analytics, and predictive diagnostics. In most of industreis, manufacturers in order to saving resources and increase the profit, do not take advantage of convenient and safe means of transfering data in fields, so that they are more relying on analysing passive logs. More, in multi-application embedded systems, managing memory in an efficient approach is a real challenge. The behavior of demand and reciprocal reactions of applications in an embedded memory can be sometimes complicated, which is led to memory crash, memory leakage; specially in period of low demand after when a system have been heavily exploited.

My small & intelligent desinged PCB to transfer wireless the data, BACnet and modbus communication protocols can give an upper hand to either embedded system and Test engineer. Logs can be rendered at the same time, Input-Output (I/O) of a MCU can be viewed easily. This helps yielding better prospective to:

Testing and Validation engineers:
 ✅ Streaming MCU data over Wi-Fi allows dynamic tracking of buffer usage, fragmentation, and memory stress.
 ✅ Analytics can predict load patterns and help optimize memory pools and allocation strategies across multiple applications.
 ✅ This creates a feedback loop: hardware data → cloud analysis → smarter memory management → improved system efficiency.
The result: a system that not only communicates, but also self-optimizes for performance, scalability, and reliability.

embedded systems engineers:
✅ Metrics to Monitor:
1) Buffer Utilization Rate: Detect under/over-allocation.
2) Memory Fragmentation Index: Identify wasted memory chunks.
3) Garbage Collection Overhead: Track CPU cost of memory cleanup.
✅ Adaptive Memory Management
1) Implement feedback-based algorithms that adjust memory pool sizes based on historical data.
2) Use priority-based allocation to give critical communication (BACnet, modbus, CANbus)messages guaranteed buffer space.
3) Apply machine learning techniques to predict memory usage patterns across multiple applications.
✅ Static vs. Dynamic Allocation:
1) Static Allocation: Fixed buffers for communication protocol frames. Predictable but wasteful in variable data load scenarios.
2) Dynamic Allocation: Buffers grow or shrink based on real-time data load, reducing memory overhead.
✅ Dynamic Buffer Management:
1) Ring Buffers (Circular Queues) for real-time streaming data.
2) Dynamic Heap Allocation for burst traffic.
3) Memory Pools to reduce fragmentation in multi-threaded environments.
