# High_Dimensional_Signal_Communication
We see how real optimized and fast communication protocols (CAN, BACnet, Profibus, etc.) transmission through wirless connection can boost the efficiecy of system. In next repository, I will implement this idea with FPGA in real world with hardware PCB designing to prove how we can increase performance.
